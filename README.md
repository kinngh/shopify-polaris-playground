# Shopify Polaris Playground

Seeing how the UI would look and interact with it without having to spin up a starter template and a stable internet connection eventually became a necessity so I could, even when I'm travelling, create UIs and see how it would actually _feel_ when the app is finally built. This also meant creating mocks and MVPs offline became viable.

The playground uses both [Polaris Web Components](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home#getting-started) and Polaris React, with active work being done to ensure we can retire Polaris React as soon as possbile. Polaris Web Components are in Beta and a lot of components are still missing, and this repo will evolve over time before a full migration hits the production repos.
